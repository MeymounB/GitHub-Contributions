### Obtaining a GitHub Personal Access Token

To use this script, you will need a GitHub personal access token. Here are the steps to obtain this token:

1. Go to the [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page.

2. Click on ["Generate new token"](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (classic).

3. Fill in the required fields:

   - **Note**: Give your token a name to recognize it easily.
   - **Expiration**: Choose an expiration period for the token.
   - **Select scopes**: Select the necessary permissions. The recommended scopes for this script are:
     - `repo`
     - `read:user`
     - `user:email`
     - `public_repo`

4. Click on "Generate token".

5. Copy the generated token and keep it in a safe place. You will need it to configure the script.

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   SORT_BY=Owner  # Change this to "Name", "Visibility", "Owner", "Is Fork", or "Original Owner"
   BETTER_READABILITY=true  # Change this to "true" or "false"
   ```

2. Replace `your_github_personal_access_token` with your GitHub personal access token.

### Usage

1. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python github_contributions.py
   ```
